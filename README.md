# TTL Audit Script

This Node.js script fetches TTL (Time-To-Live) values from a list of URLs by checking their HTTP response headers. It extracts:
- `Cache-Control`: Defines how long responses are cached.
- `Age`: Shows how long the content has been in the cache.
- `Fastly-Cache-Status`: Shows if the request was a `HIT`, `MISS`, `BYPASS`, etc.

It writes the results to a CSV file for easy analysis in spreadsheets.

## ðŸš€ Features
